Certainly! Here's a basic outline of how you can create a new instruction detection model using machine learning in Python with Google Colab. For this example, let's assume you want to detect different types of instructions in text data using a supervised learning approach.

First, you'll need to gather a dataset of labeled examples. This dataset should contain text samples along with their corresponding instruction types. You can use any text data you have or look for publicly available datasets.

Next, you'll preprocess the text data, which may involve tokenization, normalization, and feature extraction. For this example, we'll use TF-IDF vectorization.

Then, you'll split your dataset into training and testing sets.

After that, you can train a machine learning model on the training data. We'll use a simple classifier like Support Vector Machine (SVM) for this example.

Finally, you'll evaluate the performance of the model on the testing data and make predictions on new, unseen data.
